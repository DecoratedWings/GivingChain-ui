# Giving Chain front end Code

Please see video below for currently basic functionality. 
This repo will be integrated with a backend and Hyperledger Firefly.

## Steps

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

## Early Code 

Currently Metamask can be connected to from the browser. 
Each tab can upload a photo which will generate an ipfs-http call to upload 
and generate a unique CID which will represent the NFT. This hash is used as part of the url 
for the local infura node to host. 

Later a pinning service for instance will be leveraged as a permanent solution.

ReactRouter is used to change pages in the NavBar. 
Styling is also subject to change.
